**Project Name**: Coursera Analysis

**Description:** In this project, I used SQL to perform some analysis on a scraped dataset containing information about 891 courses on Coursera. The dataset consists of several variables including course providers, enrollment numbers, ratings, and certificate types. Through this analysis, I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding on the factors that influence course popularity and offer valuable insights to anyone who is considering enrolling in a Coursera course in the future.

Feel free to provide any feedback!
